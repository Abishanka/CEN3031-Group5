CMinder readme
 
This application was made to help college students organize their 
life by providing a constant reminder of when the due dates for 
their assignments are going to be.
 
This project is implemented with C++ under the QT framework.
Json is used to transmit the data from canvas to the server
and sqlite is used to store data.
 
Future implementation will add more features such as an option
to apply addition dates in advance to check assignments, changing different 
visualization methods, as well as improving visuals in general.
