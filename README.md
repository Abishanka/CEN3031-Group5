Developer Help:
    1. Folder Identification:
        a. The entire codebase for QT/QML is in MainApp
        b. Any images to be used in the application should be placed in QT_APP/Resources/Images
    2. How to clone the project succesfully and run it?
        a. Open up the project in QT Creator
            1. You can do this by opening up "QT_APP.pro" file which is the Project File and then clicking on run
            2. If that does not work:
                a. Go to PROJECTS in the LEFT PANE
                b. Change the BuildFile location
                c.Makesure the build file folder location is at the same level as QT_APP (i.e be at MainApp/)
